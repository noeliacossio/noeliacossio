# **👋 Hi, I’m @noeliacossio!!!**

### I recently finished an intensive programming course (Coding Bootcamp) in Plataforma 5 (P5), which was very challenging but,  at the same time, very rewarding as I was a person who had no idea of coding to being able to create a page web from its foundations applying different  computer tools. At P5 I first learned the fundamentals of HTML, CSS and JavaScript, and then I learned to use the latest technologies in the industry,  such as Node.js, Express, React, Redux, PostpreSQL, among others. Finally, I established all the knowledge through three complex practical projects.  In addition, they taught me to develop soft skills and learn the work dynamics of the main technology companies: working in groups and applying Scrum.

## 👀 I’m interested in creating web applications by using different technologies Node.js, Express, React, Redux and applying them in the back-end and front-end.
## 🌱 I’m currently learning new programming languages and frameworks, such as Python and Java. 
## 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any project that would help me grow as a web developer. ##
